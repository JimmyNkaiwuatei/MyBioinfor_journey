# MyBioinformatics_journey
My interest in Bioinformatics started while at my second year of studies at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. This was triggered by interest in research and driven by my passion in drug research and development. I look forward to advancing my skills and knowledge in bioinformatics through collaboration.
