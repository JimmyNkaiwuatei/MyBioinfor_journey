#MyBioinformatics_journey#

My interest in Bioinformatics started while at my second year of studies at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology. This was triggered and driven by my interest in research especially with my passion in drug research and development. I look forward to advancing my skills and knowledge in bioinformatics through collaboration.

##Mission##

To gain more knowledge in bioinformatics particularly in cheminformatics, immunoinformatics, molecualr docking and simulation in order to enhance my research and data analytics skills.

##Vision##

To promote bioinformatics research and education in Africa to accelerate African research efforts on human and pathogen genomic research and discovery for prevention and treatment of genetic diseases and antimicrobial resistance.

#Career Roadmap#

I have an interest in drug research and development and I look ahead to advancing my studies in Bioinformatics to enhance my expertise in Computer Aided Drug Research and Design (CADD). 

##Milestones##

1. Establishment of a Bionformatics Research hub in Africa.
2. Promotion of bioinformatics education and training in Africa.
3. Encouraging and catalyzing individual and institutional research collaboration within Africa.
